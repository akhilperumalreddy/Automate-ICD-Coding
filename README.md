# Automate-ICD-Coding
Automate ICD coding based on discharge summary using Pretrained Language models. This is as part of NLP 769 course group project. 

## Model Overview

In this project, we present our implementation of a transformer-based model for automatic generation of ICD(International Classification of Diseases) codes using discharge summaries. The model addresses three key challenges faced by existing methods, including a large label space, long input sequences, and domain mismatch between pretraining and fine-tuning. We conducted experiments on the MIMIC(Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care) dataset and achieved similar performance in terms of multiple metrics. Additionally, we will explore several variations to our approach, including using phecode data and transfer learning from ICD code descriptions. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of leveraging pre-trained language models for automatic ICD coding and offer insights for future research in this area.
